This portfolio was created to showcase my work in web development, graphic design, illustration, and photography. The goal was to build a visually engaging, responsive, and accessible website that highlights my skills and projects in a professional manner. The site features a clean layout, interactive elements, and a well-structured navigation system to ensure an optimal user experience across different devices. I started the development process by planning the structure and layout of the site, wireframing the design, and determining the key sections needed to present my work effectively. I focused on a modern, minimalist design with a strong emphasis on accessibility and responsiveness. Using HTML and CSS, I ensured that the site adhered to best practices in web development. Additionally, I implemented a Bootstrap framework for styling consistency while maintaining customization to align with my personal brand.


One of the primary challenges I faced was ensuring consistent styling across different screen sizes while maintaining a professional and clean design. To overcome this, I utilized CSS media queries and Bootstrapâ€™s grid system to refine responsiveness. Additionally, I encountered accessibility issues flagged by the WAVE evaluation tool, such as empty buttons and insufficient aria roles. I resolved these by adding appropriate aria-labels, ensuring all interactive elements had meaningful content, and improving keyboard navigation. Building this portfolio reinforced my understanding of responsive design, accessibility standards, and the importance of structured content. I gained experience in troubleshooting layout issues, optimizing performance, and enhancing user experience. Furthermore, I learned the significance of thorough testing across multiple browsers and devices to ensure a seamless experience for all users.

Some of the resources I used are...

Bootstrap 5.3 (CSS framework for responsive design)

Bootstrap Icons (Used for social media icons)

Google Fonts (Typography enhancements)

WAVE Accessibility Tool (For accessibility testing and improvements)

Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator (For creating and optimizing images and graphics)

GitHub (Version control and project management)

This portfolio represents my growth as a web developer and designer, demonstrating my ability to create functional, aesthetically pleasing, and accessible digital experiences.
